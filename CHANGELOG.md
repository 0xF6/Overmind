# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) 
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Added 
- Lots of new content to the Wiki!
- TerminalNetwork stat collection, which accumulates all `send()` calls and transfer costs by resourceType between origin and destination
    - Added Grafana dashboard support for new stats
- Preliminary contract module for making deals between players
- Added `Energetics` module, which will make high-level decisions based on energy distributions
- Colonies now have a `lowPowerMode` operational state, which scales back production of miners and transporters at RCL8 with full storage/terminal

### Changed
- `Task.creep` once again points to a `Zerg` object rather than a `Creep` object (Tasks are still hosted on creep prototypes, however)
- `TaskRepair` will now attempt to move to within range 2 if repairing a road; this should fix the move-stop-repair-move-stop-repair behavior of workers repairing remote roads

### Removed
- Deprecated `TaskDeposit`; use `TaskTransfer` instead
- `TaskWithdrawResource` has replaced `TaskWithdraw`

### Fixed 
- Bugfixes with `TaskDrop`, `TaskGoTo`, `TaskGoToRoom`
- Fixed bug (hopefully) with creeps not approaching to range 1 in `TaskAttack` and `TaskHeal`

### Added
- Memory stat collection and `User` variable (#3 - thanks CoolFeather2!)
- Brief setup instructions for dashboard
- Assets for possible future bunker layout

### Changed
- Added adaptive thresholds to logistics system requests, should slightly improve CPU usage

- `Zerg.actionLog` and `Zerg.canExecute()` functionality for simultaneous execution of creep actions
- Archer defense overlord and directive to defend against boosted room invasions
- `TerminalNetwork`s, `LinkNetwork`s now control terminal, link actions
- Added `screeps-profiler` dependency in favor of `screeps-typescript-profiler`

### Removed
- Haulers, suppliers, and mineralSuppliers have been deprecated in favor of transporters
- `TerminalSettings` deprecated; remaining functionality moved to `TerminalNetwork`
- Removed use of `screeps-typescript-profiler` due to inaccuracies in readout

### Changed
- Modified Bootstrapping logic to fit new transport system
