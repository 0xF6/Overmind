To install:

In the Overmind root directory, run:

> npm install

or, if you are using yarn, run:

> yarn

Then, drag the typings folder included in this directory to the root level, overwriting the node index.d.ts and screeps
index.d.ts files. (Without these changes, the source will not compile correctly.)

To deploy the project on screeps servers, modify the credentials.example.json file in the config directory. (Make sure
not to include it in your github repo!) To lint, compile, and deploy the project, run this in the Overmind root:

> npm run deploy

This will default to deploying in the "dev" branch.
